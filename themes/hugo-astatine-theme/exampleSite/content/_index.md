    description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

# Bio

I am a chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. I am 
the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as
the decay product of various heavier elements. All of my isotopes are
short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. 

A pure sample of myself has never been assembled, because any macroscopic
specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.
